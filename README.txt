Files included (20): 
ChainedEntry.java; ChainedEntryImplentation.java; Definition.java; Dictionary.java; Entry.java; EntryImplementation.java; FileUtil.java; JUnit.java; LoadPerformanceTester.java; LPHashtable.java; QPHashtable.java; SCHashtable.java; SearchPerformanceTester.java; UserInterface.java; WordType.java; lexicon.txt; README.txt, makefile, Git repository; Hashing Assignment Evaluation.odt

PLEASE NOTE: For some reason although my makefile can compile my program it doesn't seem able to actually run it. I cannot figure out why it gives me such an error. Please rather run my program within your preferred IDE.

Thank you.
